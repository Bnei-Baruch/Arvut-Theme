This project is a Liferay Theme (and Hook) for the arvut.org site.

To build it, check out the repository and run "mvn install" from the root
directory (make sure you have maven installed).

To run the server, just launch startup.sh/bat from the
    build/target/server/tomcat/bin
directory.

You can import the project into IntelliJ the usual way - by creating a new
project using the "Import project from External Model" option, and pointing
to the local repository.
