  	#
	# Set this to 0 if the locale is not automatically prepended to a URL. This
	# means that each URL could potentially point to many different languages.
	# For example, the URL http://localhost:8080/web/guest/home could then be
	# viewed by users in many different languages.
	#
	# Set this to 1 if the locale is automatically prepended to a URL when the
	# requested locale is not the default locale. This means that each URL
	# points to just one language. For example, the URL
	# http://localhost:8080/web/guest/home would point to the default language.
	# The URL http://localhost:8080/zh/web/guest/home and
	# http://localhost:8080/zh_CN/web/guest/home would both point to the Chinese
	# language.
	#
	# In cases where the prepended locale is "zh" and not complete locale
	# "zh_CN", then the full locale returned will be based on the order in which
	# the locales appear in the property "locales". If "zh_CN" appears before
	# "zh_TW", then "zh" will be a short hand for "zh_TW".
	#
	# The default language is set in system.properties with the properties
	# "user.country" and "user.language".
	#
	# Set this to 2 if the locale is automatically prepended to every URL. This
	# means that each URL points to just one language.
	#
	# Note that each language requires an entry in the property "locales" and a
	# servlet mapping in web.xml for the I18n Servlet.
